<h1>Best Pre Primary School</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In the initial years, the child’s brain undergoes major development at a rapid pace. Intending to incorporate maximum learning at this stage, we have constructed a unique curriculum for our pre-primary and primary school that is Early Years Program(EYP) students of Pre-Nursery, Nursery, K1, K2, Grade I and Grade II. The tiny tots of our EYP classes hold enormous talent waiting to be sparked through just the right push that they need.</p>
<p>The vibrant learning environment for the EYP children is a mix of several methodologies such as Montessori, Play-way theory etc. These when combined, make their journey a bright and colourful one. We focus on strengthening the foundation of learning by encouraging curiosity and independent thinking in the classrooms. Each child is motivated to ask questions and experience the learning first hand. Our multi-sensory learning approach looks after the overall development of the child. With many more such learning and techniques, we want to become a famous name for primary education in India and a chain of the <strong><a href="https://www.orchidsinternationalschool.com/primary-school/">best primary schools</a></strong> in India.</p>
<p>In our pre-primary school we have a wide range of in-house decodable books namely ‘Sound Cracker’s, where through a creative approach of phonetics, we ensure our students with fluency in reading. The thing that makes us one of the best primary schools in India is that we understand children well. Each alphabet is introduced to the students as a story through visual and audio aids. Similarly, Numeracy is taught with a hands-on learning approach, through creative numeric toys and kits.</p>
<p><br>If you are wondering which is the <strong><a href="https://www.orchidsinternationalschool.com/primary-school/">best primary school near me</a></strong> that your search is over, we are without a doubt the best primary schools in India and are widely spread primary schools in India.</p>

                        <h3> Teaching Methodology </h3>
                        <div class="tech-Method-list sub-head">
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our teaching methodology is a combination of international teaching methods and basic concepts of traditional values. Each classroom has its own learning culture encouraging creative and application-based learning. We strive to become the epitome of primary education in India.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Transition period from EYP to Primary is very challenging for a child. To ease this process in pre-primary teaching we have included Grades I &amp; II in the Early Years Program, where a child can make use of his EYP skills in Primary classes. This ensures each student in the Early Year Program instils a habit of learning the basic concepts of each subject.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As one of the best pre-primary schools in India, we believe that young minds are easily impressionable which is why we intend to make them comfortable in stepping out of their comfort zones to learn and prosper.</p>
